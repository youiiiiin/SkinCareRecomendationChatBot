## Skin Care Recomendation Chatbot
Meet my chatbot, Vivi! She will give you the best recommendation of skin care from JY-II.




# First, she would like to know your name!

# Now, tell her what products you are interested in!

When answering, users might enter with, OR without a '.'(for example: 'a.' or just 'a'). Additionally, some might even type in the name of the product(for example: 'mask').
That's why when we are writing the regex for this part, we need to enter all kind of possiblities, like symbols or capitalized letters etc.

# Time for some details
Here you can choose between knowing more about the product, or just ask for recommendation for other products.

# Deal with random answers

Sometimes users might enter random answer, so we have to also create a reply and a clear guide to bring them back!
